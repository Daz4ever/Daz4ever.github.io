            <h2>Hello Atlanta!</h2>
            <h5>August 16, 2016</h5>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

              <p>Ok, ok. I didn't just arrive here. I've been here almost 6 months now but it still feels new! Atlanta is very different from Los Angeles and the daily thunderstorms remind me of that.  I decided to make this blog so that I can share my journey over the next 4-6 months. I also wanted to practice building a website as I go through all my pre-requisite assignments (here's my first attempt <a href="http://www.TheZenonBlog.com">TheZenonBlog</a>).
              </p><br><br>
            <p>I'll be honest, when I first made the 30 hour drive to the zombie capital my gameplan was shaky at best.  I was going to continue my insurance job until I found something better but I really dispised my job and quit soon after moving.  During this time I had been completing the lessons on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="blank">Codecademy</a> because I found the world of programing intriguing. Even when I was living in Los Angeles I contemplated attending one of the many coding bootcamps in the area, but never followed through. After searching the Atlanta area for programming schools, I came across one called <a href="http://www.digitalcrafts.com" target="blank">DigitalCrafts</a> at <a href="http://www.atlantatechvillage.com" target="blank">Atlanta Tech Village</a> only 5 miles away from me. I thought they had an excellent website and I enjoyed reading their blog so I made an appointment to take a tour.
            </p>
              <img src="pics/building.jpg">
            <p>I met up with Jake, the director of student services, who sat me down in the main  lounge area to talk about my goals, the school and what the course consisted of. The tech building was very open and inviting and I could see a ping pong table in the room over, which instantly garnered extra brownie points. I got to see a class in session, who were in mid-celebration for one of the students who landed a job before finishing the course. By the end of the tour I was excited for the next steps in gaining admission which included a short coding test and interview.
            </p><br><br>
            <p>After completing the necessary steps, I was accepted into the fall cohert, which is an intensive 4 month program. To my surprise and delight, a friend from Los Angeles has also decided to enroll in the same bootcamp and will be joining me in September. Knowing that it won't be a solo adventure makes this large pill much easier to swallow.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Class begins September 12th and until then I'll just be studying...and exploring Atlanta of course. Stay tuned for my post about the first day of class!</p>

            <h2>First Day of Class</h2>
            <h5>September 12, 2016</h5>

          <p> School is in session! That exciting and nerveracking day has come and even though I've been doing the extensive list of prerequesite assignments I feel like I've barely touched the
          tip of the iceberg.  My friend Carolyn flew in from Los Angeles a week earlier and has been preparing with me. She has more experience programming so it'll be nice having her around for help, which I'm sure I'll need plenty of. </p>
          <p>The Atlanta Tech Village is in the heart of Atlanta's affluent business district with many surrounding highrises. We headed out at 8am and it only took us a short drive to get there. We met up with our 14 other classmates in the lobby and introduced ourselves. There was a meetup a couple days earlier where Carolyn and I met some of the students so it wasn't a completely new
          experience. Everyone was very friendly and Natalie, the campus director, helped us get situated
          with the parking and key passes. Since not all the students had toured the building we were shown around again and the second time was better than the first! Beer on tap, free snacks/drinks, free catered lunch every Friday, 2 ping pong tables, a fitness center, arcade/video game area, and a soon to be opened rooftop lounge. I know there's probably much more but what a great first...uh..I mean second impression! </p>
          <p>9am approached and we made our way to the classroom on the 5th floor. Inside the room were several big screen tv's and rows of desks, all with external monitors for our laptops. Our
          instructor for the next 16 weeks was going to be Toby who I had heard good things about.
          After we got settled, Toby had us stand and do a quick 30 second introduction of ourselves before we began. Our very first assignment was to create a personal website using HTML and CSS, which
          we would showcase the next day. Time flew by as we worked and before long it was 12pm, lunchtime!</p>

          <p>The rest of the class day passed by quickly and I was already excited for the next. I spent most of the
            remaining evening working on my website so that it would be at least moderately presentable for the
            next day. The only real request by Toby was that it had at least 10 pages in it, but creating content and
            styling those pages was time consuming.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>The course is very fast paced and I'm sure my spare time will be limited but I'll try to write a new
            blog post at least every two weeks. Stay tuned!
